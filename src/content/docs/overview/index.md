title: Overview
---

This website contains my personal solutions to the book [*Introduction to Algorithms, Fourth Edition*](https://mitpress.mit.edu/9780262046305/introduction-to-algorithms/).

## Motivation

I start reading this book as it is part of my exploration to my future major. 

I build this website to keep a record and possibly help others by sharing my solutions to the exercises and problems contained in the book.
